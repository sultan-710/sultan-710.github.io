# ReadMe.txt - AmsterdamClicks Website Project

## Introduction
This is my AmsterdamClicks website project, also known as Webmarkup 1.0. I've built this website using HTML and CSS. In this project, I created a design in Figma as per the assignment's requirements. The website includes 1 homepage, 4 detail pages, and a contact page.

## Homepage
- On the homepage, there's a "Get to Know Us" button, which takes you to the Community page.
- The "About Us" section has three blocks with some highlights and a button that directs you to your chosen page.
- When you hover over the navigation items in the menu, you'll notice a nice underline animation.
- I've added a showcase feature: when you hover over an image, it flips 180 degrees to reveal some text.
- There's also a contact section with a button that leads to the contact form and the contact page.

## Tips Page
- In the hero section of the Tips page, there's a button called "Photography Equipments." Clicking this button takes you to a new page, which isn't directly accessible from the navbar. It's a hidden page that can only be accessed by clicking the button on the Tips page.

## Contact Page
- On the Contact page, you'll find an email icon. Clicking on this icon will open your email client and navigate you to the email compose screen.
